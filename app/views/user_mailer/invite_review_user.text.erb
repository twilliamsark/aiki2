Greetings Sempi,

Welcome to the Aikipeace Video Library.  We are in the process of setting up a video library for our dojo.  We are inviting the Sempai to review what we are working on.

One of the new features is the ability to add notes.  Currently there are two kinds of notes.  The first is user notes, which are visible only to the user who entered them.  The second, which only Sempi and above can use are review notes.

For each video you will be able to enter review notes that only Sensei, other Sempi, and the Site Editor (Todd) will have access to.  If you do not want to enter review notes directly onto the site, please email your comments and notes to both aikido@aikipeace.com and yurusu.aikikai@gmail.com

Thank you,
Sensei Bollinger
